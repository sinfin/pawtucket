Original amateur films of the New York Worldâ€™s Fair in 1939-1940 (NWYF), and years preceding World War II (1938-1940), are important primary sources. Describing individual film reels (NYWF) and complete amateur film collections (1938-1940) exposes unknown documents of American life at a time of profound change. We invite study and use.
