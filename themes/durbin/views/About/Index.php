		Whether embedded or embattled, romanticized or ostracized, photographers appear frequently in photographs, feature
		films, documentaries, plays, novels, the front page and the evening news. "The Photographer as Subject" will analyze
		contemporary representations of the photographer and link current references to portrayals and perceptions that have
		stalked photographers through cultural history.

		As photographs are transmitted throughout the world at escalating speed, the photographer increasingly carries more cultural
		and political weight. The relationship between the photographer and his/her subject has been interrogated since the invention
		of the photography. The power of photographs to change perceptions has been relentessly examined. It now seems important to
		investigate the cultural representations of the makers of the photographs themselves.

		My blog will follow photographers and photographer characters as they journey through film and fiction, fact and fantasy, bearing
		witness, creating chaos, the voyeur and the flaneur. The blog will also address photographers well as the challenges of news
		photographers and photographers in the news.
