<p><span class="promotext">Filmmaking in the Midwest has a long history that begins in 1907 when Chicago&#8217;s Essanay Studios on Argyle Street made some of the earliest motion picture films. With the advent of 16mm film format in 1923, Chicago quickly became a center for production and distribution of educational and industrial films lasting most of the twentieth century. Chicago documentary filmmakers were among the first to work with the cinema verit√© style at the height of the civil rights movement in the 1950s. Midwest filmmaking continues today with many independent and avant-garde films made by Midwest artists. CFA&#8217;s collections include professional and amateur films, as well as those often-neglected cultural gems known as home movies.</span></p>
