			<p>The New Museum’s Digital Archive is a groundbreaking project to document the activities and programmatic history of an institution.

			<p>Most materials are fully accessible to the public on the Internet, however some are available only at the New Museum's Resource Center due to copyright restriction or bandwidth requirements.
