		<div>
			<p>The launch of the Digital Archive is the first step in a multiyear process. Additional materials will be included as we move forward. Among the materials being uploaded are audio and video files from public programs, images, publications, exhibition documentation, educational initiatives, information about the New Museum building, institutional history, and more.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Although most materials are fully accessible to the public on the web, some are available only at the New Museum's Resource Center due to copyright restriction or bandwidth requirements. We would like to hear from you. please contact us for any comments, corrections on information or if you have any additional materials to share for the Digital Archive. Contact by email at <a href="mailto:archive@newmuseum.org">archive@newmuseum.org</a>.</p> 
		</div>
		<h2><strong>HOW TO SEARCH</strong></h2>
		<div>
			<p>To begin searching the Digital Archive, simply enter a keyword—such as the name of an artist, exhibition, or publication—in the search box on the upper-right-hand corner of the screen. Results will be organized by type, so you can navigate between exhibitions, public programs, images, audio recordings, video files, publications, and even documents related to your search term. The more specific the search, the more relevant your results will be. At any time in your search you may also click a linked exhibition or artist to see a main record as well as a collection of all the digital material and information related to activity at the New Museum. You may also enter a subject such as “identity”; a date, like “1982”; or a combination of terms, for instance, “political” + “exhibitions.”</p>

		<h2><strong>HOW TO BROWSE</strong></h2>
		<div>
<p>Browsing the Digital Archive allows you to discover content or get a sense of what is contained in the database. There are several points of entry for the browse feature: people (artists, curators, authors); exhibitions; public programs (panels, performances); publications; and object types (images, sound, moving images, documents). Each of these indexes can be re-sorted by a variety of qualifiers listed on the upper-right-hand corner of the box. For a chronological list of exhibitions, public programs and books published by the New Museum, browse—and then sort by year. To see who has curated exhibitions at the Museum, browse by people and sort by role.</p>	

<p>The Digital Archive also allows you to browse within the record of an individual or exhibition, applying filters to locate the specific content you want to find. </p>

			<h2><strong>THANK YOU</strong></h2>
<p>The New Museum’s Digital Archive is made possible, in part, by a generous grant from The Henry Luce Foundation.</p>

<p>The New Museum Digital Archive is a result of extraordinary effort. We would especially like to thank all the artists; curators; collaborators; and Whirl-i-Gig, the developer of CollectiveAccess, for their contributions. We are especially thankful to the New Museum staff members who have contributed their time and expertise: Perry Garvin, Digital Projects Manager, for designing the front-end interface; Doron Ben-Avraham, Information Technology Manager, for managing technical implementation; Jonathan Vingiano, Webmaster, for front-end development; our consultant, Julia Weist: for advising on archival protocols, and all the wonderful interns that have made the Digital Archive possible.</p>
