Welcome to the Center for Book Arts online collections database, an indexed, searchable online resource that contains the Center’s historic, eclectic (and growing) collection of approximately 2,000 artists' books and prints created by artists and publishers of regional, national, and international significance; reference books, periodicals and exhibition catalogues. In the coming months, the Center will also present its institutional archive, which documents the distinctive history of the Center’s programmatic and administrative activities as the first non-profit book arts organization of its kind in the United States.
<br/><br/>As a leading book arts institution, the Center hopes to use this online collections database to further extend its educational commitment to the exploration and pedagogy of aesthetic interpretations of the book as an art object, and to encourage new dialogues about historic and contemporary book arts practices among artists, curators, academics, historians, arts administrators, librarians, collectors, educators, and students.
<br/><br/>If you are interested in viewing particular holdings, The Center for Book Arts collections are open by appointment and welcomes qualified researchers, artists, curators, educators, and students. To make an appointment, please call the Center: (212) 481-0295, or email: <a href="mailto:info@centerforbookarts.org">info@centerforbookarts.org</a>
