  <p>Lisa Hayes is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Fashion  and Design &amp; Merchandising. She teaches the capstone Senior Project,  Portfolio Presentation, and Sportswear courses in the Fashion Design Program. We chose  to highlight her research because it exemplifies our programâ€™s focus on the  importance of both the two dimensional and the three dimensional processes in inspiring  and realizing fashion design. It also addresses a collaborative design process which uses technology to communicate to team members. Her research also includes examination of  sustainability in fashion design production and sourcing.
