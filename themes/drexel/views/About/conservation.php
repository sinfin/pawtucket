<div id="apDiv0056">Textile  conservation is necessary for the preservation of historic costume. Conservation  literally conserves what is already in existence and prevents further damage in  the future. Textiles are fragile by nature and are further compromised when  exposed to the natural oils and acids of the skin. Textiles are further  weakened by environmental conditions such as humidity and light.</div>

Preventative  conservation, which emphasizes proper handling, storage, and display, is  essential to the successful preservation of costume and textiles. While  preventative conservation is the best method for preventing damage,  conservation treatments are sometimes necessary to stabilize objects that are  already damaged. These treatments may include cleaning, stabilization and  compensation for loss. Silk textiles from the early 20th century are particularly  fragile. Dresses from this period are frequently damaged under the arms and may  be conserved with an overlay of fine crepaline silk.
