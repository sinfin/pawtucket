The Drexel Digital Museum  Project: Historic Costume Collection (<em>digimuse</em>) is a searchable image database comprised of selected  fashion from the Drexel Historic Costume Collection (DHCC), designs loaned  to the project by private collectors for inclusion on the website, fashion exhibitions curated by Drexel faculty and fashion research by faculty and students. To best present and create access to this  online resource, the image  standards of the Museums and the Online Archive of California initiative and  the metadata harvesting protocols of the Open Archive Initiative have been  implemented o insure sustainability, extensibility and  portability of the <em>digimuse</em> digital archive.Â  Thank you to the Barra Foundation, the William  B. Dietrich Foundation, the Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association,  CollectiveAccess, Lois Lunin and the Westphal College for their generous  support of the project.
